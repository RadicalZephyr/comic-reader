# Comic-Reader

An app for reading comics/manga online.

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/RadicalZephyr/comic-reader

## Usage

Just run it!

    $ java -jar comic-reader-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Development

Run `lein repl` then, `(welcome)` to get an overview of your options.

### Adding a new site

From the `comic-reader.dev` namespace you can run `(add-site)`. This
should set up your REPL to pretty easily run the site scraping tests
with `(run-site-tests)`.

In theory, adding a new site shouldn't require writing any code.
First, create a new file in the `resources/sites/` folder. Name it
`<your-manga-site>.clj`. Now, you need to fill in all the attributes
for your site. You can look at other site files in that folder for
guidance but the best source of information is running the tests in
`comic-reader.sites-test`, like so (in a REPL):

``` clojure
(require 'comic-reader.sites 'comic-reader.sites-test)
(in-ns 'comic-reader.sites-test)
(run-tests)
```
